## Jazz Listening

### How this resource works:

Add the <b>General listening</b> tracks to your playlists this week. Listen around them and their artists and albums if you can.

Write detailed answers to the <b>Focused listening</b> questions. They often start with <b>listening questions</b> (no cheating just yet!) then some <b>research</b> on artists or techniques (Wikipedia is a great resource for albums and personnel...). Sometimes the answers will appear in <span style="color:red">red</span>, sometimes we'll wait for the lesson to reveal all.
