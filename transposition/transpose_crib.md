## Transposing by changing clef

One strategy, particularly when transposing at sight, is to pretend the music is in a different clef.

See [this article](http://www.sfcmtheory.com/essays/musicianship/clef_transposition.pdf) for an excellent explanation.

* Bb Transposition: Tenor clef (read up an octave)
* D Transposition: Alto clef (read up an octave)
* A Transposition: Soprano clef (read as written)
* F Transposition: Mezzo-Soprano clef (read as written)
* G Transposition: Baritone clef (read up an octave)
