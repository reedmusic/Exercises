## Mnemonics

* **I** **D**on't **P**articularly **L**ike **M**odes **A** **L**ot (&copy; Anna)

## Definitions

* A mode is the major scale, starting on a different scale degree. 
* There are seven scale degrees so there are seven modes
* If you start on the second scale degree, this is known as the second mode or Mode II. Mode III starts on the third degree, etc.

Number  | (Modern) Name | Definition 
:--- | :--- | :---
Mode I | Ionian | Major scale
Mode II | Dorian	 | Natural minor with &#x266e;6
Mode III | Phrygian | Natural minor with &#x266d;2
Mode IV | Lydian | Major scale with &#x266f;4
Mode V | Mixolydian | Major scale with &#x266d;7
Mode VI | Aeolian | Natural minor scale
Mode VIII | Locrian | Natural minor with &#x266d;2 and&#x266d;5


## Worked examples

Q: Identify the notes in F# Phrygian.

1. Phrygian is **Mode III**.
2. To find the underlying major key signature, treat F# as the **third scale degree** of some major scale.
3. This major scale is **D major**.
4. F# Phrygian therefore has **D major key signature**, but starting at F#: F#-G-A-B-C#-D-E

Q: Identify this mode: F#-G-A-B-C-D-E

1. Treat the scale as a re-sorted major scale. 
2. Identify the key signature: **one sharp (F#)** = **G major**
3. Look again at the first note in the mode and identify its position (scale degree) in the scale: **F# is the seventh scale degree in G major**
4. Identify the mode: **Locrian**, so **F# Locrian**.

## Optional background

* Each mode has a name based on&mdash;but not identical to&mdash;the [Medieval modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(music)#Western_Church), which are themselves derived from the ancient [Greek modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(music)#Greek_scales), hence the Greek names. Why were there [twelve](http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/misc/modes.html) Medieval modes?
* Since the modern modes are based on the **major** scale, are there only **seven** modern modes? If there are more, what are they called and how are they used?
