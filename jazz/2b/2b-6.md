### Bill Evans Trio: 'Waltz for Debby'

This recording is a bit late for Eduqas, but it's based on a solo piano recording released in 1956. Note the great descending bassline.

Difficult harmony question: Look at the piano's final bar before the 4/4. It's labelled G7, but how would you label what Bill Evans plays fully? By the way that should probably be a C#, not Db.
