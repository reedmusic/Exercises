1. Describe the texture of the introduction.

	<details>Polyphonic/contrapuntal</details>
	
2. Give the timings when the head starts and ends (i.e. where does the next section start?)

	<details>0:13, 1:07</details>
	
2. Name the instrument that plays the head.

	<details>Vibraphone</details>
		
3. Compare the rhythm of the introduction and head sections

	<details>The introduction uses straight quavers and the head uses swung quavers.</details>
	
4. Identify the structure of the head.

	<details>AABA. 32-bar song form.</details>
	
6. Describe how the harmonic rhythm changes through the head.

	<details>
	<ul>
		<li><b>A sections</b>:Faster harmonic rhythm. Either one or two changes per bar.</li>
		<li><b>B section</b>: Slower harmonic rhythm. Generally one chord change every two bars.</li>
	</ul>
	</details>

5. Describe the (other aspects of) harmony and tonality of the head section.

	<details>
	<ul>
		<li>The A sections mainly focus on the tonic chord. The chord progression in the A sections is very repetitive, arriving at Chord V and then descending back down to i each time.</li>
		<li>The head is in a minor key.</li>
		<li>The B section starts in the relative major key. However this quickly modulates back to the tonic minor.</li>
	</ul>
	</details>

2. The head has an unusual 20-bar structure. There are a few possible interpretations, based on whether you prioritise melody or chord progression (I can see multiple instances of the same 4-bar progression). What do you think is the best analysis? Come back to the lesson with an argument! 


	If that's not enough: have a listen to the solo choruses. What harmonic variations do you hear here?

	If that's not enough, did you hear the transition between the vibes and piano solo?

1. Describe the music played by the piano in the head section
	
	<details>A sections of the head are played in octaves. In the B section they improvise instead of playing the melody. The B section uses comping in the left hand. Chord extensions used, e.g. a V7#9 chord in the final turnaround</details>
	
1. How many solo choruses does the pianist play? Give the time each chorus starts. (I have to count the bars and beats on my fingers to keep track.)

	<details>4 choruses in total. Each is about 38 seconds long.
	
	<ol>
		<li>0:39</li>
		<li>1:17</li>
		<li>1:55</li>
		<li>2:32. This starts with four bars of dominant pedals at the start of the first two A sections.</li>
		<li>Coltrane starts at 3:10</li>
	</ol>
	
	</details>
	
1. What is Coltrane playing? Is this normal?

	<details>Soprano sax here. He usually plays tenor.</details>
