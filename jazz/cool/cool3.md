	<details><b>Minor pentatonic</b> but there is a slight hint of the #4 in the ornaments in the second and third phrases, so I'll accept <b>blues</b></details>
	
	Optional question. What is the interval between the tenor sax and trumpet in the accompaniment phrases?
	<details>6th.</details>
	
	
3. 	Miles Davis: 'Pan Piper'. 0:00–1:00

	This is hard: listen for a while since the tonic becomes clearer around 0:30.
