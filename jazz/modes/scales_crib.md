## Pentatonic scale

<table>
<tr>
	<th>Name</th><th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>C Major pentatonic</td>
	<td>C, D, E, G, A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>A minor pentatonic</td>
	<td>A, C, D, E, G</td>
</tr>
</table>

Note that pentatonic scales operate similarly to major and minor scales:

* Major pentatonic scales and their relative minors share the same notes.
* Start a major pentatonic on the sixth to 'convert' it to the minor pentatonic scale.

## Blues scales

### Blue notes

Early Blues singers and guitarists used (predominantly) the minor pentatonic scale, bending the pitch of some notes to make them more expressive. Over time these 'blue notes' (#4, but this also refers to the b3 and b7) became adopted by instruments with fixed pitches.

<tr>
	<th>Name</th><th>Notes</th>

	<td>C (Minor) Blues scale</td>
	<td>C, Eb, F, F#, G, Bb</td>

<tr>
	<td>Eb Major Blues scale</td>
	<td>Eb, F, F#, G, Bb, C</td>

* The Minor Blues scale is more important. We usually omit the word 'minor'.
