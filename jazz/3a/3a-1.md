### [Sonny Rollins: 'I'm an old cowhand'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlatJOsLhPA)

1. Describe the music played by the drums in the introduction

	<details>
		<ul>
			<li>Woodblock</li>
			<li>Hi-hat (foot pedal)</li>
			<li>Snare drum rim click</li>
			<li>Swing (quavers)</li>
			<li>Bass drum accent on beat 2.5 of every second bar</li>
			<li>Repeating two-bar pattern/ostinato</li>
		</ul>
	</details>
	
	
3. We hear the head twice at the beginning. How many bars long is it?

	<details>18. There is an extra repetition of the final phrase (the turnaround).</details>
	
2. Describe the structure of the head in letters
	<details>AABA (A, A' or C to finish. More ambiguous than usual since that final section has two extra bars and starts with a melodic development from the B section).</details>
	
3. Describe how the music played by the rhythm section changes during the B sections in the head (e.g. at 0:23)

	<details>
		<ul>
			<li>Bass starts walking</li>

		</ul>
